# goodservice

This is a Rails app that generates live route maps, detects headway discrepancies, track delays and compare runtimes to the schedule on the New York City Subway system by comparing the data for live countdown clocks with the static schedule data provided by the MTA.

~~See it live at [https://www.goodservice.io](https://www.goodservice.io/).~~

## Running locally

To run locally, you'll need a couple things. First, the app has only been tested with Ruby 2.4.2 and Rails 5.2. We suggest managing this with `rbenv`. It also depends on Redis, Postgres, Yarn, and Semantic UI React. If you are on a Mac with Homebrew installed, you can get all these requirements with the following commands:

```
# Ruby dependencies
brew install rbenv
brew install ruby-build
rbenv install 2.4.2
gem install bundler
gem install rails
gem install foreman

# Other dependencies
brew install postgresql
brew install redis
brew install node
npm install -g yarn
```

Next, you'll need to sign up for a developer account with the MTA. To do so, go to [https://api.mta.info](https://api.mta.info). You'll get an API key and set it as `MTA_KEY` env variable.

Finally, you'll need to download the current static schedules from the MTA. Go to [https://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html](https://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html), agree to the terms, and then download the data for New York City Transit. (Ctrl+F for "GTFS".) Put this into the `import` folder and unzip it.

Finally, to run the app locally, do

```
export MTA_KEY=<<YOUR API KEY>>
bundle install
yarn install
initdb
rails db:reset  # This will take a *very* long time on its first run
rails dev:cache
foreman start
```

## A brief tour of the code

This is a Rails app that uses React as a view manager. As such, there are a lot of moving components. We briefly explain how data flows and how the code is laid out.

### Server side: Rails

The server performs two major functions: First, it runs a cron job that updates the current status of all routes and lines. This cron job is located in `/lib/clock.rb`. It is currently hard coded to refresh train data every minute and to refresh route data every five minutes.

Second, it actually serves up the route info that is processed by this cron job. In particular, a Redis cache maintains all the headway info that is served by API (described below). All of the models that are used to process this information live in either `/app/models` or, closer to the ultimate product, in `/app/models/display`. If you want to start tracing through the code, you should begin at the `self.headway_info` function in `/app/models/schedule_processor.rb`.

A rake job at `/lib/tasks/scheduler.rake` is to be run daily to compile runtimes comparison history from the model LineDirectionStatus into JSON and stored into the LineStatusSummary model, as the LineDirectionStatus table can get really big. The job is indempotent, so it would not be a problem if it ran more than once.

Another cron job located in `/lib/clock.rb` runs daily at midnight to clear out old rows of data storing train statuses that drive the pretty graphs and historical stats.

### Client side: React

The client side view libraries are a React app that is compiled by the `webpacker` gem. For more information on `webpacker`, you can see their [repository](https://github.com/rails/webpacker). But the basic summary is that all entry points (in React lingo) live in `/app/javascript/packs` and are compiled to the `/public` directory. As with all Rails apps, this is driven by the views in `/app/views`, which are basically the bare minimum to get the compiled React to appear.

### In the middle: An API

The React front end is fed by an API that Rails serves. The routes are specified in the `/app/controllers` directory. Specifically, dynamically-generated routes are specified in `/config/routes.rb`. The `/api/info` route is probably most interesting as it drives the main React app. This route refers specifically to the `/app/controllers/api/info_controller.rb` controller. Note that that file is a very thin wrapper around the `ScheduleProcessor`'s `headway_info` function, which is specified in `/app/models/schedule_processor.rb`, simply returning a JSON of the results.

## Supported external services

### Twitter

The cron job to update route statuses is also capable of tweeting a list of delayed routes every 10 minutes. Make sure the env variables `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`, `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET` are populated.

### Slack

`/app/controllers/api/slack_controller.rb` handles the API endpoints used to serve the goodservice.io Slack App, found [here](https://www.slack.com/apps/AGK7ZP2AH-goodserviceio). The API pulls from Redis the JSON compiled by the cron job and transforms into a JSON structure that Slack can use. `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` env variables are required to allow installation of the app on to a Slack workspace. The env variable `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is needed to process Slack API requests.

### Dead Man's Snitch

Dead Man's Switch integration is supported to allow monitoring of the cron jobs being run. Ensure the env variables `DEADMANSSNITCH_API_KEY` and `DEADMANSSNITCH_TOKEN` are populated.

### Google Analytics

The React frontend app uses `react-router` module to change browser's URL in the single-page app, so the app detects URL changes and sends the new URL to GA. Events that don't change the URL (i.e. certain modals and tabs, and Slack app events) are also sent to GA as events. Currently, the GA ID is hardcoded.
